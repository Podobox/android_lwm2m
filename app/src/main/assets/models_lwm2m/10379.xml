				<Description><![CDATA[Triggered or raised Events are captured in this Events Captured resource. The triggered or raised Events must be listed in the Events to Capture resource to allow the capture. 
For Events structure definitions, a recommendation is to use the definitions for Events and related serialization as found in the shared resource 6025: Latest Eventlog Payload (with an Event Code, Event Type, Event Timestamp and optional data).
The Events Captured list should be sorted by increasing Timestamps (oldest Events first).
The maximum size of the Events Captured list is implementation specific.
When the Events Captured list reaches the maximum size, it should roll-over and start back from the first entry (overwrites that first entry).
On triggering or raising of an Event that needs to be captured (listed in the Events to Capture resource), that Event should be implicitly captured in (added to) the Events Captured resource.
If the Capture resource is supported, an explicit capture of a triggered or raised Event can be accomplished via an execution of that Capture resource.

Assuming the use of an Event serialization as found in the shared resource 6025: Latest Eventlog Payload (with an Event Code, Event Type, Event Timestamp and optional data), the Capture Event method would use the following arguments:
