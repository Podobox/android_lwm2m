                <Description><![CDATA[Event Type is a readable and writable resource used to represent how this event will behave. Event Type should be one of the following values:-
                0. Disabled
                1. Alarm Current State
                2. Alarm State Change Log
                3. Event Log

                When the Event Type is set to Disabled (0), this event will not be recorded by the device. No Latest Eventlog payload should be delivered for events that are Disabled.
                When the Event Type is set to Alarm Current State (1), this Event is treated as an alarm state manager and the Latest Eventlog Payload will only contain the current state of this alarm.
                When the Event Type is set to Alarm State Change Log (2), the Event is treated as an alarm that reports whenever the Alarm is either set or cleared. The Latest Eventlog Payload will contain all alarm transitions since the previous delivery in this mode.
                When the Event Type is set to Event Log (3), this object instance is treated as a raw event log. It is used to manage and deliver events. The Latest Eventlog Payload will contain all events since the previous delivery in this mode.

                See the Event Log Payload for examples of each of these modes.
